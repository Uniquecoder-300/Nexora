  "review": "After using the smartwatch for nearly two months, I can confidently say that it has become an integral part of my daily routine. The first thing that impressed me was the sleek and minimalist design — it pairs well with both casual and formal outfits, and the lightweight build makes it comfortable to wear all day. \n\nFunctionally, the watch delivers more than I expected at this price point. The step counter is mostly accurate and motivates me to stay active throughout the day. Heart rate monitoring and sleep tracking have been reliable, giving useful insights that I've started using to improve my sleep schedule. The Bluetooth calling feature is a huge plus, especially when I'm cooking or driving — the mic quality is surprisingly clear. \n\nBattery life is commendable. I charge it once every 5-6 days with moderate usage (including workouts, music control, and occasional calls). The display is bright and crisp even under sunlight. I’ve also enjoyed customizing the watch faces through the companion app. Notifications sync well, and the UI is smooth with minimal lag.\n\nIf I have to nitpick, the only downside is the limited third-party app support — I would’ve loved integration with more fitness apps. Also, the straps are good quality but attract a bit of dust.\n\nOverall, it's a fantastic buy if you're looking for a budget-friendly smartwatch that doesn’t compromise on style or performance. I’ve already recommended it to two of my friends!",
